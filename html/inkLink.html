        using a blue water strategy mindset to find a niche market Preferably with a low competition rate. We set out to empathize with the tattoo market because I realized that there was no tattoo finder app on either the Google or Apple app store. The tool that was used here was Uber Suggest to measure and analyze this data to understand where there is a market to sell to. Once it was understood that there was an opportunity to make a profit in this market area we commenced to the research and testing phase. 
        To explore ways to fix these issues while fulfilling a demand for a much wanted and lucrative need. Ink link is an app that connects people in search of tattoo parlors. It is designed to demonstrate the process or story of a tattoo artist while providing details like price range and location, it also has the social media aspect that lets ink fanatics show off their work and promote the work of the artist.

These are potential customers for the app that reflect people who are searching to satisfy their need for tattoos. The data shows the search value of over 246,000 people searching this phrase on a daily basis of which the searchers are between the ages of 35-44 year old individuals . This is a good search demographic because these are generally a working age group. The information continues to tell that most of the users are on some type of mobile device that demonstrates the need for an app. The SEO difficulty is based off of a scale of 100 which means that the odds of someone from the search results clicking on a search link is just around 50/50
    This would not be a good statistic if the the paid clicks outweighed the organic clicks 
    (which are unpaid search results). The number of paid clicks are low which tells me that the need for a paid SEO ad is lower. Although the number of clicks means less likely chance of a conversion. Since the organic SEO clicks are high this is a very good thing. It means the app can save money on paid ads. And still produce efficient results. Finally this shows a good blue water strategy since the app will highlight the prospective search businesses and clients instead of competition. This means that all the users that search for the term “tattoo near me” will have a high potential of drawing traffic through the app. Where we could gain revenue from in-App advertisements and clients who would like to get an up on the competition for a small fee. With a low cost per click this looks like a good niche app to develop.
